for all my things that i want to make public, but don't deserve their own repo

do what you want with these

### gitbot
profile view bot for use with this : https://github.com/antonkomarev/github-profile-views-counter 

just change the url to your view counter and run
```bash
py gitbot.py
```

### tokenlogin
simple script to make logging in with someones token a little easier [not that id ever need/use this ;)]

run the script and input the token
```bash
